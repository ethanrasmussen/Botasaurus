# Botasaurus
Simple bot written in Python to automatically play the Google Chrome "T-Rex Run!" game.
The "T-Rex Run!" game can be found [here!](https://elgoog.im/t-rex/v2/)

## Dependencies:
- pyautogui
- OpenCV for Python (cv2)

## Usage:
To utilize this bot, you'll need 'botasaurus.py' as well as 'start_dino.png' and 'dino.png.' Then, you must open a tab with the "T-Rex Run!" game, and run 'botasaurus.py' (or it's main() method). Ensure the Python command line doesn't block the game, as this may prevent the bot from functioning properly.
